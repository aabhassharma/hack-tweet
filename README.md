This is a simple multi step experiment to see if I can get increased Twitter traction using some simple software.

Here are the steps to collect the data:
1. Write a script that runs periodically, finds the most popular hashtags trending on Twitter
2. From the most popular hashtags, find the most popular tweets that meet some criteria related to those hashtags.
3. Save most popular tweet data to file

Now that we have the data, here's the tweet part:
1. Use simple NLP to see if we can determine some sentiment about this text
2. If the NLP returns a negative sentiment, throw the data away
3. If neutral or positive, store in a file for further processing

Now that we have a file of neutral and/or positive data, multiple approaches we can take:
1. Simply retweet what was said (Phase 1)
2. What I'm more excited for : Take the trending word, make a simple sentence from it using NLP, tweet that

STATUS:
We're almost done with the data collection parts!
